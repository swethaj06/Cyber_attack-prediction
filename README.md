----Cyber Attack Prediction using Machine Learning----

This project aims to predict potential cyber attacks using machine learning techniques by analyzing  data. It is designed to help organizations detect threats in advance and strengthen their cybersecurity infrastructure.

-----------Project Overview---------

With the increasing number of cyber threats, proactive defense mechanisms are crucial. This project uses cyber attack  datasets from kaggle  to train ML models that can classify and predict various types of network intrusions, anomalies, or suspicious activities.
